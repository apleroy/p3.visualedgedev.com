P3 - Dynamic List

This javascript application allows the user to create a list with individual list items.

A user can add, edit, and delete list items and can change the order of appearance through drag and drop.  Users can also modify the color appearance of items.

Much of the CSS and styling came through the use of bootstrap and the sticky footer was downloaded and implemented following the documentation provided here: http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/examples/sticky-footer.html
